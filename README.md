# Countdown Days Widget For Android

![logo](http://www.peregin.com/apps/countdown/100_icon.jpg "Countdown Days")

The widget will help you to countdown the days until a given date.
It shows the remaining days or even the working days left if you are interested in such a counter.

## Project Setup

Some notes regarding the project setup and structure:
* The project was extracted to be published on GitHub from a multi module configuration, therefore the module used for testing is not available here
* The project is maven based. It can be compiled and packaged via command line.
* The following environment variable needs to be configured for the maven-android-plugin: *ANDROID_HOME*.
* I was using Eclipse and IntelliJ as IDE to develop this widget, the meta files generated by these IDEs are committed as well

## Work In Progress And Wish List

I've got a lot of feedback, ideas and comments, here are the upcoming items:
* multi-size widget - work in progress - currently only 1x1 size is available
* show remaining weeks or months (not days only)
* consider adding holidays in the calculation of the remaining days
* customizable icons to associate to specific events

## The Beginnings

This is how the widget started, I couldn't find a simple widget which counts the working days as well, so I decided to write one :)
At the very beginning I just sketched how the widget would look like:

Then the next step was to prepare the vector based graphics with Inkscape:
